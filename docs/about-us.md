Daniel is a Cuban-American aerospace engineer, pilot, and polymath who has worked to improve corporate operations, integrated governance, organizational ergonomics, and strategic change implementation. He is known for identifying small, counter-intuitive changes within complex organizations that result in disproportionally large and sustainable returns that remain stable at scale.

He earned a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan and went on to graduate school three times, publishing research in nanotechnology, teaching programming, and earning two master's degrees in business and organizational leadership. He maintains licenses and certifications in human resources, change management, traditional and agile project management, and executive coaching.

Daniel began his career in research and product development as a propulsion aerodynamicist for Boeing in Seattle, where he facilitated major, cross-functional design and manufacturing integrations as the lead project engineer for propulsion on the 777X airplane. In 2018, he left Boeing to start his own business to demonstrate that similar patterns existed across domains including cybersecurity, food production, digital marketing start-ups, among others.
