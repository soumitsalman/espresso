    _How do I find stuff that is interesting?_ That was the question that sparked the creation of Espresso. It all began one breezy October evening, over cigars and some dubious moonshine shared with my long-time partner in questionable decisions, Danny. Among all the topics that came up, this one stuck: _How do we help people discover content that truly matters to them?_ Espresso, a product of Project Cafecito, is our attempt to answer that question. It’s a news and social media aggregator designed to deliver only the content that you care about.
    
    Espresso currently comes in a mobile-friendly web interface and as a Slack bot, designed to fit seamlessly into your daily workflow. While it’s still in the alpha phase, and yes, you might occasionally come across random texts like baa-baa-baananaaaa or bizarre categorizations that defy reason, we’re continuously refining our AI models to make it better. The slack app is focused ONLY on last 24 hours of news. For better visualization and more configurability, use the web version https://espresso.cafecito.tech which also includes social media feeds.

    Espresso is not a new social media platform, nor do we have any intention of making it one. The original content is hosted on various external sources (that are not us!). What we offer are AI-generated digests of this content, giving you a quick snapshot so you can decide whether the original is worth diving into. Our goal is to save you from wasting time on clickbait and shallow content.

    Today, Espresso doesn’t track per-user engagement or fine-tune itself based on your personal preferences — but that’s coming soon. We’re hard at work to make Espresso a smarter, more personalized tool so that every session feels like a quick, invigorating shot of espresso tailored to your tastes. Join us on this journey as we brew the perfect cup of content just for you.

    Espresso — Stay ahead, effortlessly."
