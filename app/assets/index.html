        <h1>Espresso - Project Cafecito</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Ah, welcome to the chaotic family reunion of Project Cafecito's digital disasters—I mean, innovations. You know how caffeine addicts like us can't settle for just one jolt? Well, neither can we. We've brewed up a trio of "smart" tools under the Espresso banner, each promising to revolutionize how you consume news without actually requiring you to read anything worthwhile. Spoiler: They're all interconnected in ways that make me question our life choices. Let's break it down before you regret clicking that link.</p>

        <div class="tool">
            <img src="/assets/images/espresso.png" alt="Espresso API Icon">
            <h2>Espresso API: The Backend Beast We Pretend Isn't a Frankenstein (You're Already Here)</h2>
            <p>Shh, don't tell the developers, but this is the unglamorous engine room: A scrappy MCP server that scrapes RSS feeds daily like a caffeinated squirrel hoarding nuts. Query it with natural language ("gimme the dirt on quantum hacks") or tags, and it'll spit back curated news payloads faster than you can say "rate limit." It's the secret sauce behind Beans—because building a frontend from scratch sounded like too much work.</p>
            <p>What you'll get: JSON bliss for devs: Endpoints for searching, filtering, and fetching fresh content. Free tier for tinkering, paid for when your app scales (or crashes spectacularly). If you're into APIs that feel like they're judging your prompts, this is your jam. (api.cafe... wait this is actually not ready yet)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool">
            <img src="/assets/images/espresso.png" alt="Espresso Beans Icon">
            <h2><a href="https://beans.cafecito.tech">Espresso Beans: The RSS Whisperer Who Thinks It's a Psychic</a></h2>
            <p>Tired of RSS feeds drowning you in irrelevance? Enter Espresso Beans, our "smart" aggregator that's basically a glorified bookmark folder with delusions of grandeur. It slurps up feeds from across the web, then—get this—cross-references them against social media buzz to surface the "trending" gems. Think Twitter likes + Reddit rants = your new homepage. (In theory. In practice, it's 80% cat videos and 20% "did you know AI is taking over?")</p>
            <p>What you'll get: A clean dashboard of handpicked (er, algorithm-picked) news, blogs, and hot takes, sorted by engagement so you never miss the outrage. No more wading through digital sludge—unless the algo decides your vibe is conspiracy theories today. Pro tip: It's powered by our API below, because why reinvent the wheel when you can duct-tape it? (<a href="https://beans.cafecito.tech">https://beans.cafecito.tech</a> — log in, pretend you're productive, and thank us later.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool">
            <img src="/assets/images/espresso.png" alt="Espresso Publications Icon">
            <h2><a href="https://espresso.cafecito.tech">Espresso Publications: The Overachieving Wordsmith</a></h2>
            <p>Picture this: A blog that's less "curated journalism" and more "AI hallucinating op-eds at 3 AM." We feed the bots a f**k ton of data streams and it poops out polished(ish) articles on everything from phishing scams to why your startup is doomed. It's our humble flagship—humble like a barista who accidentally decafs your double shot.</p>
            <p>What you'll get: Bite-sized brain food (or junk, depending on the prompt). Subscribe for weekly doses of "insights" that sound profound but mostly just aggregate headlines we wish we broke. (<a href="https://espresso-cafecito.ghost.io">https://espresso-cafecito.ghost.io</a> —because nothing says "premium content" like a subdomain.)</p>
        </div>

        <p>There you have it: The full Espresso lineup, from eloquent essays to API plumbing, all stitched together with varying degrees of hubris and code smells. We're not saying it'll change your life—just that it'll make your newsfeed slightly less boring than doom-scrolling alone. Got feedback? Hit us up before we automate that too. Sip on, friends. ☕</p>
